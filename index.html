        I had came into programming when I was in 8th grade at school. I was excited by the things which are possible to implement with knowing a programming and computers.<br>
        So that time I decided to connect my future with this area. It has gone 6 years from first programm written by myself, and I want to continue and grow up as professional software developer.</p>
        <p>I have a big experience in programming LEGO robots. Every time I code something I think about my schooltime, when I was spending all my time to implement some particular functions, which are required in robototechnic competitions.
        I gained unmeasurable pack of personal qualities which are extremely needed for programmers:</p>
